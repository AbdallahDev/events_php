# events_php
this is a project for the JHR events i've started this project in 2017 and 
finished the working on the php project for the screens on the same year.
but in 2018 i've started a new android project depend on this one, and after i 
made a separate project called EventsNotifyPHP, i've moved to the original 
project here to make the work more centralized for the php events web app and the 
android app.
so in the future this project will be for both the events web app and the 
android app.
